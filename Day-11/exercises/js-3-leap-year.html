    <p>
      To eliminate this error, the Gregorian calendar stipulates that a year
      that is evenly divisible by 100 (for example, 1900) is a leap year only if
      it is also evenly divisible by 400.
    </p>
    <p>For this reason, the following years are not leap years:</p>
    <p>1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600</p>
    <p>This is because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.</p>
    <p>The following years are leap years: 1600, 2000, 2400</p>
    <p>This is because they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400.</p>

      // 2000 яах вэ? 400 яах вэ? /* In the Gregorian calendar, a normal year
      consists of 365 days. Because the actual length of a sidereal year (the
      time required for the Earth to revolve once about the Sun) is actually
      365.2425 days, a "leap year" of 366 days is used once every four years to
      eliminate the error caused by three normal (but short) years. Any year
      that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year: for example, 1988, 1992, and
      1996 are leap years. However, there is still a small error that must be
      accounted for. To eliminate this error, the Gregorian calendar stipulates
      that a year that is evenly divisible by 100 (for example, 1900) is a leap
      year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400. For this reason, the
      following years are not leap years: 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300,
      2500, 2600 This is because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by
      400. The following years are leap years: 1600, 2000, 2400 This is because
      they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400. Because versions of
      Microsoft Excel earlier than Excel 97 handle only years from 1900 to 2078,
      only the year 1900 is subject to the 100/400 exclusion rule of leap years
      in Microsoft Excel. However, in order to be compatible with other
      programs, Microsoft Excel treats the year 1900 as a leap year. How to
      determine whether a year is a leap year To determine whether a year is a
      leap year, follow these steps: If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to
      step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5. If the year is evenly divisible by 100,
      go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4. If the year is evenly divisible by
      400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5. The year is a leap year (it
      has 366 days). The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days). */
